Hello World! My name is Kaloyan and I am interested in web development. I have started my coding journey since 2021. My intensions are to be the best version of myself. The road must be hard but this will never stop me dreaming and doing stuff I like. The reason I want to become a software engineer is my passion to solve problems. 

In my free time in love doing - calisthenics, going to the gym, cooking, coding for fun of course and last but not least to hang out with my friends.
